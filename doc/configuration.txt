.Version information
NOTE: This section applies to `crmsh 2.0+` only.


`crm` can be configured using both a system-wide configuration file,
and a per-user configuration file. The values set in the user-local
file take precedence over the system-wide settings.

The global configuration file is usually installed at
`/etc/crmsh/settings`, and the user-local configuration file at
`~/.config/crmsh/settings`.


== Upgrading from crm 1.x to 2.x ==

The configuration file format and location changed significantly going
from crm 1.x to 2.x. If `crm` cannot find a user-local configuration
file when starting up, it will look for an old-style configuration
file at `~/.crm.rc`. If this file exists, `crm` will prompt the user
asking if the old-style configuration should be  automatically
converted to a new-style configuration file.


== Format description ==

The `settings` file consists of sections introduced by a `[section]`
header, and followed by `name=value` pairs.

Leading whitespace is stripped from values.

Values can contain format strings referring to other values in the
same section.

Lines starting with `#` or `;` are interpreted as comments.

Values starting with `$` are interpreted as environment variable
references, and the value will be retrieved from the named environment
variable if set.

== Example configuration ==

The example configuration below lists all available options and their
default values.

----------------------
[core]
editor = $EDITOR
pager = $PAGER
user =
skill_level = expert
sort_elements = yes
check_frequency = always
check_mode = strict
wait = no
add_quotes = yes
manage_children = ask
force = no
debug = no
ptest = ptest, crm_simulate
dotty = dotty
dot = dot

[path]
prefix = /usr
datadir = %(prefix)s/share
sharedir = %(datadir)s/crmsh
cache = /var/cache/crm
crm_config = $CRM_CONFIG_DIR, /var/lib/pacemaker/cib
crm_daemon_dir = %(prefix)s/lib64/pacemaker
crm_daemon_user = hacluster

[color]
style = color
error = red bold
ok = green bold
warn = yellow bold

help_keyword = blue bold underline
help_header = normal bold

keyword = yellow
id = normal
attr_name = cyan
attr_value = red
resource_reference = green
id_reference = green
score = magenta
ticket = magenta
----------------------


== Syntax highlighting ==

By default, `crm` will try to syntax highlight its output when
connected to a TTY. To disable this behavior, set the configuration
value `style = none` in the `[color]` section.

The available color choices may depend on the terminal used, but
normally include the following:

----
black blue green cyan red magenta yellow white
----

Colors can be combined with styles:

----
bold blink dim reverse underline normal
----

== Setting options from the interactive shell ==

Options can be set directly from the interactive shell using the
`options` sublevel. These options will be written to the per-user
configuration file. Note that changing an option in this way may erase
comments added to the configuration file.
