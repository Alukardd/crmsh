// == Cluster history ==
// 
// The history of a cluster is stored in more than one place and on
// more than one host, which makes it notoriously difficult to
// follow. This guide introduces the `crmsh` history feature. It
// digs out and presents bits of cluster history from the logs or
// policy engine input files (transitions).
