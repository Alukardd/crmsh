= crmsh 2.0 vision =

This is my vision for `crmsh 2.0`.

* Modular

* No globals

* Fully functional cluster sublevel with ansible integration

* Cleaned up msg module with better error messages

== Installation ==

Simply do `pip install crmsh` or `zypper install crmsh` on one of the
machines, then go

----
crm cluster init nodes=node-a,node-b,node-c
crm cluster apply web-server virtual-ip=192.168.10.10
crm cluster status
----

This will ensure that all necessary packages for corosync, pacemaker,
apache etc. are installed on all the nodes, and also verifies
connectivity and network health across the cluster. It then configures
corosync, installs a basic CIB, makes sure that the cluster is up and
running, configures apache with mod_status and then adds resources for
a web server with a virtual IP, and finally verifies that everything
works okay.

To execute some arbitrary task across the cluster, run

----
crm cluster shell '/bin/ls -l'
----

To add another node to the cluster, run

---
crm cluster join node-d
---

`crmsh` makes sure to reload the corosync configuration to insert the
new node on the fly.

== CIB management ==

* Allow rules everywhere that Pacemaker does.

== Completion ==

* Fully functional tab completion in interactive mode.

* Fully functional bash tab completion.

* (optional) Fully functional zsh tab completion.

== hawk ==

* Enable hawk to use the `crm cluster apply` mechanism in its wizards.
