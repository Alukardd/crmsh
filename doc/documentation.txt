The SUSE
https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle_ha/book_sleha/?page=/documentation/sle_ha/book_sleha/data/book_sleha.html[High
Availability Guide] provides a guide to
installing and configuring a complete cluster solution including both
the `crm` shell and Hawk, the web GUI which uses the `crm` shell as
its backend.

For more information on Pacemaker in general, see the
http://clusterlabs.org/doc/[Pacemaker documentation] at `clusterlabs.org`.

On the Pacemaker website, there is a set of guides to configuring
Pacemaker using `crmsh`. To find these guides, go to the documentation
page and search for `crmsh`.
