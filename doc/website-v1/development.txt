== Building crmsh ==

The source code for `crmsh` is kept in a
http://git-scm.com/[git] repository
hosted at https://github.com[github]. Use the
command-line tool +git+ to get a working copy:

----
git clone https://github.com/crmsh/crmsh.git
----

`crmsh` needs the source code to `cluster-glue` and `pacemaker` when
installing. On openSUSE, these are packaged as `libglue-devel` and
`libpacemaker-devel`.

.Building
----
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install
----

=== Unit tests ===

The test suite uses nose. On most distributions, this can be installed
by installing the package +python-nose+, or using +pip+.

To run the unit test suite, go to the source code directory of `crmsh`
and call:

----
./test/unit-tests.sh
----

=== Regression tests ===

`crmsh` comes with a regression test suite. The regression tests need
to run after installation, on a system which has pacemaker
installed. To execute the tests, call:

----
/usr/share/crmsh/tests/regression.sh
cat crmtestout/regression.out
----
