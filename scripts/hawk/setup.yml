- name: Install and configure the Hawk web UI
  description: >
    Hawk is a web-based GUI for managing and monitoring Pacemaker HA
    clusters. It is generally intended to be run on every node in the
    cluster, so that you can just point your web browser at any node to
    access it, e.g.:

    ........
    https://your-server:7630/
    ........

    This script ensures that all requirements to run Hawk are fulfilled.

  steps:
    - name: Ensure apache2 is installed
