# INTRODUCTION

crmsh is a command-line interface for High-Availability cluster
management on GNU/Linux systems. It simplifies the configuration,
management and troubleshooting of Pacemaker-based clusters, by
providing a powerful and intuitive set of features.

crmsh can function both as an interactive shell with tab completion
and inline documentation, and as a command-line tool. It can also be
used in batch mode to execute commands from files.
