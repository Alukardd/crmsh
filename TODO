Features

. Audit

	- add user auditing, i.e. save all commands that were run

	- save to a local file (distributed DB would probably be an
	  overkill)

. Cluster documentation

	- one of the more recent features is graph capability
	  (graphviz) which is a very good step in terms of cluster
	  documentation; need to extend that with some textual
	  cluster description and perhaps history and such

	- everybody likes reports (and in particular your boss)

	- this feature needs very careful consideration

Misc

. Create a web page

	- there's already space at crmsh.nongnu.org

	- preferred to be based on asciidoc or similar
