Features

. Audit

	- add user auditing, i.e. save all commands that were run

	- save to a local file (distributed DB would probably be an
	  overkill)

. Cluster documentation

	- one of the more recent features is graph capability
	  (graphviz) which is a very good step in terms of cluster
	  documentation; need to extend that with some textual
	  cluster description and perhaps history and such

	- everybody likes reports (and in particular your boss)

	- this feature needs very careful consideration

. CIB features

    - Rules in primitive attribute declarations

        primitive dummy ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 \
          params 3: rule 0: #uname eq pcmk-1 nic=eth1 \
          params 2: rule 1: #uname eq pcmk-2 nic=eth2 \
          params 1: netmask=32 ip=127.0.0.1 nic=eth0

      Adding parser support is easy.

      Difficulty is adding support for multiple sets of parameters
      with different scores
      (right now they are all aggregated) in cibconfig.py
